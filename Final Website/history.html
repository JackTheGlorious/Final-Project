            <p>
                Glorious Pheripherals started as 1 man's dream. That man was our founder David G. Frustrated with the lack of safe and releaible places for custom hardware, he set out to make his own. Founding Glorios Pheripherals as a small business out of his garage. Selling his controllers to people at his local.

        <p class="center">
            After popular demand the business started to grow. Taking in more employees. In the local region of Glorious Peripherals we account for 80% of all custom controller in the region. Dave eventually hired the current CEO Jerry H. Jerry H. was fresh out of college getting a degree in computer engineering. With Jerry's help Glorious Pheripherals was able to start working on even more controllers and pheripherals. From the help of Jerry, Glorious Pheripherals was able to grow to the company it is today. With over 100 workers and now shipping nation wide through this very site.
